So you've decided to build your site/blog using eleventy and now that you want to publish on github pages, you find out its not working, get constant 404s or get github build error messsages that leave you wondering, which config am I missing?, is there something wrong with my code?, isn't it supposed to just work? its just a static site after all.

Well fear no more the following guide will show you the way on how to configure github and eleventy without the need of external tools, or cumbersome process.

The first step is to tell github that our site is not based on jekyll source, to do so you simply need to add an empty `.nojekyll` file to the root.

``` text/2-3
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
